# 📊 IBM Employee Attrition Dashboard

### 📖 Overview
This dashboard was created to analyze employee attrition within a simulated IBM dataset. The report evaluates key metrics such as **Total Employee Count**, **Attrition Rate**, and **Job Satisfaction**, and segments these figures across departments, age groups, education fields, and gender.

The dashboard uses visual analytics to highlight factors potentially driving attrition, allowing HR to identify and address at-risk employee groups, improve retention strategies, and enhance overall job satisfaction.

### 🎯 Project Objective
- Build a single-page visual or dashboard in Tableau to analyze employee attrition.
- Identify the **departments** with the highest attrition rates.
- Determine which **demographics** (Age, Gender, Education Field) are most susceptible to attrition.
- Analyze the relationship between **Job Satisfaction** and Attrition across different job roles.

### 🔍 Key Insights

#### **Departmental and Role-Based Attrition**
* **R&D and Sales Volume:** Research & Development (R&D) and Sales account for the vast majority of attrition volume, at 56.32% (133 employees) and 38.82% (92 employees) respectively. This is expected given the high number of employees in these departments.
* **Job Satisfaction (Low Scores):** The **Laboratory Technician** and **Sales Executive** roles show the highest number of employees rating their job satisfaction as 1 (Low) or 2. This is a critical area for HR intervention, indicating potential dissatisfaction in these key roles.

#### **Demographic Breakdown**
* **Gender Attrition Disparity:** The Male Attrition Rate ($18.14\%$) is significantly higher than the Female Attrition Rate ($15.61\%$).
* **Age Concentration:** The largest volume of employees is concentrated in the **25-35** age brackets (325 and 297 employees), making these groups a priority for retention efforts. The 25-30 group represents the highest single volume (325).
* **Education Field:** **Life Sciences** and **Medical** are the fields with the highest volume of employees who have left the company.

### 📝 Lessons Learned

This project served as a crucial step in re-establishing my proficiency with Tableau, marking my return to the platform after a nearly **15-year hiatus** in my 23-year data analysis career. My primary objective was capability restoration; specifically, demonstrating mastery of current Tableau functionality, modern data connectivity, and calculation handling.

While the visual design intentionally referenced established community patterns for the widely-used IBM attrition dataset (allowing me to focus on the 'how' rather than the 'what'), the project successfully delivered a complex, single-page analysis. Crucially, this exercise affirmed my ability to quickly adapt core analytical principles to contemporary BI tools, significantly boosting my confidence in leveraging Tableau for future engagements.
